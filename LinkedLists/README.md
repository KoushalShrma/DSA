## üéØ Essential LinkedList Patterns

### **Floyd's Cycle Detection (Tortoise & Hare)**
```java
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        if (slow == fast) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### **Two-Pointer for Distance**
```java
// Remove nth node from end
ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
dummy.next = head;
ListNode first = dummy, second = dummy;

// Move first n+1 steps ahead
for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    first = first.next;
}

// Move both until first reaches end
while (first != null) {
    first = first.next;
    second = second.next;
}
```

### **LinkedList Reversal Template**
```java
public ListNode reverseBetween(ListNode head, int left, int right) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    ListNode prev = dummy;
    
    // Move to position before left
    for (int i = 0; i < left - 1; i++) {
        prev = prev.next;
    }
    
    // Reverse the sublist
    ListNode curr = prev.next;
    for (int i = 0; i < right - left; i++) {
        ListNode next = curr.next;
        curr.next = next.next;
        next.next = prev.next;
        prev.next = next;
    }
    
    return dummy.next;
}
```

### **Merge Pattern for Sorted Lists**
```java
public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
    ListNode curr = dummy;
    
    while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
        if (l1.val <= l2.val) {
            curr.next = l1;
            l1 = l1.next;
        } else {
            curr.next = l2;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        curr = curr.next;
    }
    
    curr.next = (l1 != null) ? l1 : l2;
    return dummy.next;
}
```

## üîß LinkedList Best Practices

### **Dummy Node Pattern**
```java
ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
dummy.next = head;
// Simplifies edge cases where head might change
```

### **Safe Null Checking**
```java
while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
    // Safe to access curr.next.next
}
```

### **Preserve References**
```java
ListNode prev = null, curr = head, next;
while (curr != null) {
    next = curr.next;  // Store next before modifying
    // Perform operations
    prev = curr;
    curr = next;
}
```

## üéØ Interview Tips

1. **Draw It Out**: Always sketch the linked list and pointer movements
2. **Edge Cases**: Consider empty lists, single nodes, and null pointers
3. **Dummy Nodes**: Use dummy nodes to simplify head modifications
4. **Null Safety**: Always check for null before dereferencing pointers
5. **Space Optimization**: Many problems can be solved with O(1) extra space
6. **Multiple Approaches**: Know both iterative and recursive solutions where applicable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

1. **Null Pointer Exceptions**: Always validate before accessing `.next`
2. **Lost References**: Store next pointers before modifying links
3. **Off-by-One Errors**: Carefully count steps in two-pointer problems
4. **Memory Leaks**: In languages like C++, remember to free unused nodes
5. **Infinite Loops**: Be careful when modifying pointers in cycles

## üèÜ Advanced Concepts

- **Skip Lists**: Probabilistic data structures for fast search
- **XOR Linked Lists**: Memory-efficient doubly linked lists
- **Lock-Free Linked Lists**: Concurrent programming concepts
- **Memory Pool Allocation**: Optimizing node allocation/deallocation
